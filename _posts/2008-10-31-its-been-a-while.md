excerpt: It's been a while since I've actually used this site, so I'm deciding to break the cycle by posting something.    It's been a crazy 8 months.  I've learned and used some pretty cool stuff the past 8 months including&nbsp;<a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/">AppleScript</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml">XML</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap">SOAP</a>, Web Services, and of course <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>. &nbsp;I even went back to school at VVC at night to finish up some general studies so that I might one day get a Bachelors Degree. &nbsp;I just need to complete two more classes at VVC to transfer to CSUSB as Junior. &nbsp;Not sure when I'm going to finish those classes, but hey, I'm closer to getting a degree, hooray.

<p>It's been a while since I've actually used this site, so I'm deciding to break the cycle by posting something.    It's been a crazy 8 months.
