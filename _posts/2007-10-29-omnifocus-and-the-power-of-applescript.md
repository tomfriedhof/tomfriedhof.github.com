title: OmniFocus and the power of AppleScript
layout: post
excerpt: If you've heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> and you're an a mac, than you've probably heard of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> by <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a>.  I've been using the Sneaky Peak of OmniFocus for quite some time now since I switched from <a href="http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/">iGTD</a> after a couple weeks of use in that program.  I must say that I've really enjoyed using OF.  It just has that macness quality to it where it looks good and works even better.

This past week I got curious of how to use OF more effectively, see what other users were doing with the application.  After checking out the <a href="http://forums.omnigroup.com/index.php">Omni Forums</a> I came across <a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/~clifton/software.html">this site</a>.  It's crazy how <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/">AppleScript</a> can interact with applications directly.  Now I have another task in my @R&amp;D context.  I need to learn AppleScript and really streamline my processes.
