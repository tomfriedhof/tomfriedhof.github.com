title: Got a Soekris 4801
layout: post
excerpt: I've been keeping my eye on embedded computers lately, particularly the <a href="#mce_temp_url#">Soekris 4801</a>.  Well, I finally bought one.  These little computers are really cool.  You can install <a href="#mce_temp_url#">Linux</a> or <a href="#mce_temp_url#">BSD</a> on these little devices and pretty much have them do whatever you want.  I didn't get a hard drive with mine, I'm going to use an old 512 MB <a href="#mce_temp_url#">Compact Flash</a> card to hold the OS, which will be more than enough room for what I'll be using it for.

As it says on the m0n0wall web site:</p><blockquote>						<span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 15px; font-family: Verdana" class="Apple-style-span">m0n0wall is a project aimed at creating a complete, embedded firewall software package that, when used together with an embedded PC, provides all the important features of commercial firewall boxes (including ease of use) at a fraction of the price (free software).<br />						</span>	<span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 15px; font-family: Verdana" class="Apple-style-span">m0n0wall is based on a <strong>bare-bones version of FreeBSD</strong>, along with a web server, <strong>PHP</strong> and a few other utilities. The entire system configuration is stored in one single XML text file to keep things transparent.</span> </blockquote><p>This should be a fun project.  I'm just hoping that my FIOS connection doesn't give me any issues with the new gateway because it's pretty particular about what device is connected to it.</p>
