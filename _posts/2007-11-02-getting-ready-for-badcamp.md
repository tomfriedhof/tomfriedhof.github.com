title: Getting ready for BADCAMP

excerpt: Well I just arrived here in Berkeley after about 7 hours in the car with my wife and two toddlers.  We bought portable DVD screens that mount on the back of the front passenger head restraints before we started our journey.  The screens worked great for the first six hours of the trip, but the last hour on the road was a little crazy with my son.  Luckily he fell asleep about 10 minutes after I turned off the screens.

It's an “un-conference” based on community knowledge, sharing and collaboration.  I look forward to meeting a lot of people and learning a lot while I'm here. </p>
