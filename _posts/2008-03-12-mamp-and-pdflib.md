title: MAMP and PDFlib
layout: post
excerpt: I mainly use <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php">MAMP</a> when developing web applications locally. MAMP is great because you can easily switch from PHP4 to PHP5, it's very easy to configure, and everything is built into one package.  However I do have a second development environment setup on my machine.  I also use the package that <a href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/">Marc Liyanage</a> made available, but I only use this environment if I am dealing with <a href="http://www.pdflib.com">PDFlib</a>, because PDFlib does not work with MAMP.  It's lame having projects in two different development environments depending on if I need PDF support.
