        I finally found the format of the directory.xml file for my Polycom 501 IP phone after searching the web for about a half hour looking for it.  Where better place to keep the format than in the <a href="/files/PolycomAdminGuide167.pdf">Polycom Admin Guide</a>.  I found an entry on <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/index.php?page=Polycom+Soundpoint+IP+501">voip-info.org</a>, but it didn't mention all the XML elements I could use.  So being the curious guy that I am, I had to know all the options available to me.

        Well I just arrived here in Berkeley after about 7 hours in the car with my wife and two toddlers.  We bought portable DVD screens that mount on the back of the front passenger head restraints before we started our journey.  The screens worked great for the first six hours of the trip, but the last hour on the road was a little crazy with my son.  Luckily he fell asleep about 10 minutes after I turned off the screens.

        If you've heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> and you're an a mac, than you've probably heard of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> by <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a>.  I've been using the Sneaky Peak of OmniFocus for quite some time now since I switched from <a href="http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/">iGTD</a> after a couple weeks of use in that program.  I must say that I've really enjoyed using OF.  It just has that macness quality to it where it looks good and works even better.

        I recently heard about a really cool open source software program on <a href="http://leoville.com/blog/">Leo Laporte's</a> radio show &quot;<a href="http://www.twit.tv/ttg">The Tech Guy</a>&quot;.  It's called <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/">Synergy</a>.  The software allows you to share the keyboard and mouse of one computer with other computers, and it does this all through software, no hardware needed.  The typical way of doing this in the past was by installing a hardware <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a> that you physically hooked your keyboard and mouse up to (and video, if you want), and then had to either physically press a button on the switch, or press a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_key">hot-key</a> on the keyboard to have your keyboard and mouse switch to the other computer.

        <img class="float-right" src="/files/logo.gif" width="187" height="62" />I was chatting with <a href="http://cleverclevergirl.com/">Crystal Williams</a> yesterday, the amazing organizer that put together the recent <a href="http://barcamp.org/DrupalCampLA">DrupalCampLA</a>, and she mentioned the <a href="http://www.sisumedia.com/">company</a> she works for just launched the new <a href="http://www.trixbox.com/">Trixbox</a> commercial site with <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>.  It's a very clean design and implementation of Drupal.
